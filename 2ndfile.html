This is  the second file added to Git Practice Repo.
Will use this to test git restore.

Now, let me try using this same file for git restore --staged.

Okay so we teste git restore --staged and git restore both.
So git restore --staged, keep teh chages in local working directory and push teh file out of staging.
However, git restore, restores the file from previous commit and changes are made to local directory too.

Adding line to test the exclusion

Addeding line after cache removal
